        <p>Starting from the bottom, the jacket and tee. I used an array of opaque and dark turquoise tones for the jacket. The rimmed collar on the jacket took me the longest time to complete, but i felt having these individual rims really brought texture to the illustration. I used light blue and grey tones for darker areas on the white tee, to allow some shadowing to appear. </p>

    <div class="jbneck"> 
        
        <img src="img/jbprocess/jbneck.png">
        
        <p>For the neck i used more adventurous colours rather than the colours of his actual skin tone. I used a light muddy yellow for beneath the shadow and an almost burnt orange for edge of his neck. I did this to help stray from his pale complexion and add to my illustraive style and feel. </p>

        <img src="img/jbprocess/jbface1.png">
        
        <p>I continued using the orange on the sides of Justin's face, for consistency and character. The mouth was a different experience and process, as it was my first illustration with teeth. That being said it wasn't that difficult, not as much as i was expecting anyway. For the lips i used a few distorted shapes for highlights, i feel these little shapes are what lift an illustration the next level.</p>

    <div class="jbface2"> 
        
        <img src="img/jbprocess/jbface2.png">
        
        <p>Justins eyes, especially in this picture, are quite slim and narrow. This made it harder to perfect detail but not impossible. I used a cropped circle with a circular gradient for each iris, it's a very simple technique but works brilliantly. For the eyebrows i used a range of overlapping shapes, with a gradient ranging from light to dark to medium. I tried a multitude of different techniques before this one, but surprisingly this one looked and worked the best.</p>

     <div class="jbhair"> 
        
        <img src="img/jbprocess/jbhair.png">
        
        <p> I put a lot of detail into the hair on this illustration. I tried a range of different minimal and simplistic looks for the hair but none looked or felt right. The only way i could really capture the entity of the famous quiff was to work in alot of detail. I did this by carefully structuring each shape to the flow of the hair and using a number of different tones, with different gradients! It took some time but was without doubt worth it. The detail in the hair allows this illustration to reach a different level. </p>

    <div class="jbbg"> 
        
        <img src="img/jbprocess/jbbg.png">
        
        <p> Once again because yellow and orange was used within this illustration, i wanted a more vibrant version of these colours to be used as the background. The yellow looked much better at the outline as it lifted the illustration more. Thankfully my instagram followrs agreed.  </p>
