        <p>I started the ‘Ari’ illustration with her pink jumper. This allowed me to size the illustration correctly, it’s a nice easy start to the process. I used light grey and pinks in a variety of different tones to capture the correct feel of Ari’s jumper. It was really just a matter of examining and understanding the different folds and ruffles of the jumper, and then portraying this is a more 2D manner.</p>

    <div class="arineck"> 
        
        <img src="img/ariprocess/arineck.png">
        
        <p> The neck was the second area I worked on, working from the bottom up quickly became an essential technique for me. I stuck to tones as close to Ari's skin tone as possible. I really tried to define features like her collar bone and jawline, as they are features that really stand out with Ari.</p>

    <div class="ariface1"> 
        
        <img src="img/ariprocess/ariface1.png">
        
        <p>The face was slightly more complex. Again i used colours as close to Ari's skin tone as possible with the exception of exaggerating certain colours to help emphasis lifted features, like her nose and cheekbone. I used red for her lips as red is a lip colour most associated with Ari. It also helped brighten the overall look of the illustration and capture the vibrant popart feel that i am trying to portray within my illustrations. </p>

    <div class="ariface2"> 
        
        <img src="img/ariprocess/ariface2.png">
        
        <p>Slowly making my way up the illustration i reached the eyes. I felt there was already alot of cut tones and shapes throughout the face that i wanted the eyes to be slightly more relaxed and smooth. I created the eyes with few shapes for a more simple look, using slight gradients on each shape. I used the same technique with the eyebrows, each brow being one shape with a slight gradient. For the ear i decided to create it the same way i did the face, i wanted the ear to fit in with the face as oppose to standing out.  </p>

     <div class="arihair"> 
        
        <img src="img/ariprocess/arihair.png">
        
        <p>The hair was without question the most difficult part to this illustration. In the photo i was using for reference, Ari had different plaits and beads in her hair leading up to her high pony tail. Altough leaving these out would have made it much simplier for me, i wanted to add as much detail as possible when it came to aspects like this as these details are what makes up the celebrity. So i tried my best to recreate these in my illustrative style. For the pony tail itself i simply used long shapes curving into the hair tie. I used a variety of different tones with each gradient to help capture the flow and length of Ari's pony tail. </p>

    <div class="aribg"> 
        
        <img src="img/ariprocess/aribg.png">
        
        <p>With the background i wanted bright, vibrant colours to help the illustration stand out. I also wanted to use these colours to help add to the popart atmosphere. I knew i wanted a hot pink because pink would be one of the first colours that comes to mind when i think of Ari, but also to help with the contrast of her jumper. The variation of the background colour was actually decided by my instagram followers. I create instagram polls to interact with my followers on instagram and to allow them to have say on the vital decisions i make when creating my illustrations. Whatever the majority vote is, that is what i create! </p>
