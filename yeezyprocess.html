        <img src="img/yeezyprocess/yeezysuit.png">
        
        <p>With this illustration i again started from the bottom and made my way up. I wanted to add more colour to this illustration, i used deep tones of blue and purlple to help in areas of contrast. I made the suit quite simple to add to the sleek aspect of his suit.</p>

    <div class="yeezybeard"> 
        
        <img src="img/yeezyprocess/yeezybeard.png">
        
        <p>Moving on up the illustration i worked on the neck, well what can be seen of his neck, and the beard. I found the beard quite difficult. A lot of his skin can seen through his beard, with an illustration that is quite difficult to achieve. To keep this simple and to my style i simply created the outline shape of his beard and varied the gradient between dark blues and purples! I then added a variety of small skin coloured shapes to act on behalf of his skin peeking through.</p>

    <div class="yeezyface1"> 
        
        <img src="img/yeezyprocess/yeezyface1.png">
        
        <p>The face on this illustration was to some what fun and relaxing to complete. The face is very symmetrical, making the entire process alot easier. As you can see i continued using deep shades of blue and purple for the darker areas on his face. For the lips i tried to mirror the same tone on Kanyes actual lips. I used very small lightly coloured shapes for highlights. </p>

    <div class="yeezyface2"> 
        
        <img src="img/yeezyprocess/yeezyface2.png">
        
        <p> Continuing up the illustration next was the eyes and eyebrows. For the eyes i kept it simple but added a combination of mangled off white circles for highlights. In terms of the eyebrows i decided on using one shape that continues on down into the shadow of his nose. I used the purple and blue shades again in the brows as they are quite dark. </p>

     <div class="yeezyhair"> 
        
        <img src="img/yeezyprocess/yeezyhair.png">
        
        <p>The hair on this illustration was very simple and easy. It is essentially just five shapes, with the correct gradient of colour on each. Although it was easy to complete it is in no means unimportant. The simplicity of the hair adds to the overall illustration and structures it perfectly within my illustrative style.</p>

    <div class="yeezybg"> 
        
        <img src="img/yeezyprocess/yeezybg.png">
        
        <p>For the background i felt it was only right to use blue and purple, as those colours have played such a huge part in this illustration. I found the perfect shades of blue and purple that allowed my illustration to be lifted. The order of these colours was again of course decided by my instgram followers. </p>
